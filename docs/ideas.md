We listen to people that have nothing to say.
People that talk a lot have nothing to say.
Listen to the silence, it has so much to tell you.

# Social Engagement

As an producer I want to monitor the behavior of other users As a consumer I want to engage with other users by
sharing/liking/commenting on articles As a consumer I want to read other people activity for an article I am interested
in As a consumer I don't want to be spammed As a consumer I want to see comments of people I don't know

It should be able to engage with other users - maybe to stay consistent with existing approaches like twitter - in the
following ways:

- comment
- like, share / retweet or archive

# Use Cases

- integrate into zettelkasten, suggest for zettelkasten
- follow my profile

  - resolve html url ->
- how does social stuff work?
- inbox/queue for your private feed

- editor https://github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-markdown-editor
- kotlin: add endpoint to suggest article
- score article
- sync to github (
- archiving an article `a`:
  - `a` has to be linked to a user-article
  - `a` is quoted in a user-article
- Private Streams:
  - notifications: notification of other users
  - archive: you network
  - inbox: suggested articles that are related to an archived article

# Archive Funktion

Wenn man einen guten Artikel `a` archivieren will, soll `a` nicht nur plump in eine Liste gesteckt werden. Gemäss dem
Zettelkastenprinzip soll jeder Artikel mit mindestens einem anderen verlinkt werden mussen um einen Kontext zu schaffen.
Jeder Artikel im feed soll dann links anführen, unabhängig vom Content. Links: Artikel -> Artikel

- Grab major image for article
- Tag white and black list.
- You can just follow a page, even if it does not look like a collection. In theory it is a collection of different
  versions over time. There should be a field in the article to store mapping content
- like readability. A mimeType for this field should also be specified.

- import subscriptions form twitter, hn, yt
- browse UX
  - reader https://www.srf.ch/audio/sounds/nell-the-flaming-lips-where-the-viaduct-looms-ein-maerchen?id=12099281
  - feed ui like apple podcasts https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/stuff-you-should-know/id278981407
      or https://philpeople.org/profiles/dominique-kuenzle
- customize feed fields opt-in/opt-out when fetching them
- yt support
- query
- retention
- feed gen pre and post flow
- list with filters and search
- reader mode
- validation
- remixing, quotes
- content creation: an article is a proxy for comments

Level of Abstraction
- manual accumulation, manual scoring: go through a lot of documents and decide if it is relevant for you
- request what you want: automated scoring, automated accumulation: search engine
- get what you want: automated querying and automated scoring, automated accumulation

Deployment Box
- rasp-pie with usb-stick storages
- app connects via super-node to this box, so you have a local backup
- you can share a secret so people can connect to your box (dyndns)
- there should be several types of secrets
  - visibility level
  - share data level
  - owner level

Next Step:
1. docker + storage mounts
3. extend the atom feed with custom attribute using the spec https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4287#section-6
4. next/prev/last/first
5. pingback -> activitypub
6. feed should be signed
7. feed Ids may be spoofed
8. Landingpage: Enter a url site or create raw feed
9. display site meta (distinguish list vs article)
10. display best feeds (native > merged-native > generated). Score generated feeds based on area covered + subscribe button. Guess columns and allow filtering.

- support some kind of subscription (websub) but allowing slaves to be behind a nat
- text files e.g. logs
- root note
- article is site, aritcleRef is note which may reference a site or stand for itself

slave nodes connect to master using ws
- master stores non-private feeds used by slaves
- slaves are used as routers to request websites ()

blog experience
- render feed like wordpress does
  - list https://www.srf.ch/audio/sounds
- render autodiscovery tags with unique id to identify user?
- video harvest should be async
- every article has a related articles feed
- stt for podcasts https://www.ubuntupit.com/best-open-source-speech-recognition-tools-for-linux/
