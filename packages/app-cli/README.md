# CLI

The `CLI` is a command-line tool that helps you manage your feeds and subscriptions and fetch articles based on a query. 
With this tool, you can easily add new feeds, remove existing ones, and search for articles across all your subscribed feeds
and trigger post processes.

## Installation

To install the `CLI`, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. Once you have Node.js installed, you can run the following command to install the tool globally:

```shell
npm install -g @damoeb/feedless-cli
```
